DevOps Project Demo 2

Deploying Spring PetClinic Sample Application localy using Docker

Use source code from your Gitlab repo


Subtask I - Application

Add "docker" folder and put there all Dockerfiles and doker-related scripts if any, then commit and push them in your Gitlab repo.
Install docker on your host machine
Create Dockerfile for application container
docker build should:

Clone git project and checkout to branch specified in $BUILD_BRANCH
Use .m2 dir from host machine
Build java project
Put application jar into separate folder
Have a separate non-root user to own the application
Expose the 8080 port
Tag image as petclinic-app


on docker run it should start java app and connect to mysql database using credentials that you provide in environment variables.



Subtask II - Database

Create Dockerfile for DB container

Customize the mysql database to accept connections only from your private docker network subnet
Create a non root user and password (ENV $MYSQL_USER and $MYSQL_PASSWORD) in mysql
Create a database in mysql (ENV $MYSQL_DATABASE) and grant all privileges for the $MYSQL_USER to access the database
Expose default mysql port
Mysql should save data on host machine, so that it remains persistent after image rebuild
Tag image as petclinic-db






It's up to you what base images to use.

Try to keep images as small as possible make use of Dive



Subtask III - Docker registry

Create your own docker registry on Gitlab or DockerHub

Push images there



Subtask IV - Jenkins

Setup Jenkins
Deploy Jenkins on Local VM or Docker
Setup Jenkins plugins (credentials, git, maven-plugin, github, Gitlab, docker, etc.)

Create a 1st Jenkins Job it should build your project, package jar into docker image and deploy that image to a Docker registry.
Create a 2nd Jenkins Job it should build Database image and deploy that image to a Docker registry.





Additional tasks

Create your own docker registry on host machine and Push images there
Create a job that will be triggered on changes in gitlab repo.
Describe Jenkins job using Job DSL syntax to create jobs automatically
Setup Jenkins job to look for Jenkinsfile in your project root directory
